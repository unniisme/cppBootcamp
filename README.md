3. Calculate n!
4. Calculate the nth fibonacci number
5. The idea of t testcases for a cp problem
6. Take input till sum exceeds 100, then return how many inputs have been taken

## Arrays
1. Find min, max and average of n input numbers
2. Find all fibonacci numbers upto n
3. For n inputs between 1 and 30, find frequency of each number

## Functions
Re-implement the previous questions using functions

2. Calculate the nth fibonacci number using recursion

## Strings

1. Draw an n sided pyramid using '*'s
2. Write a program that reverses an input string

## Pointers
Only overview, and 1 pass by reference function

## GCC
C/C++ code is compiled using GCC in Linux(GNU) and MinGW in Windows  
gcc is used to compile C and g++ to compile C++  
Basic gcc commands

```
$ g++ [name of file] -o [name of output file]
```
note: -o [output name of file] is not neccessary. By default it compiles to a file named `a.out`.

To run the compiled file, simply do
```
$ ./a.out
```
or, for file name,
```
$ ./[name of output file]
```
